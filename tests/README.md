# Test Suite for Modernized Application

## Overview
This test suite provides unit tests for the modernized Bank of America application, covering the conversion from:
- JDK 1.8 to JDK 17
- Spring 5 to Spring Boot 6.1
- WebSphere to JBoss/WildFly

## Test Coverage Summary

### 1. ModernizedApplicationTest
- Tests Spring Boot application context loading
- Validates ApplicationInfo bean creation
- Tests JDK 17 record validation with null/blank checks
- Coverage: Main application class and configuration

### 2. SampleControllerTest
- Tests REST endpoint functionality
- Validates JDK 17 switch expressions
- Tests record-based DTOs
- Coverage: Controller layer with different response scenarios

### 3. JBossConfigurationTest
- Tests JBoss/WildFly configuration
- Validates JNDI context creation
- Tests migration from WebSphere configurations
- Coverage: Configuration classes and properties

### 4. ModernServiceTest
- Tests sealed class hierarchy
- Validates pattern matching functionality
- Tests Stream API enhancements
- Coverage: Service layer with JDK 17 features

## Running Tests

### Using Maven
```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run with code coverage
mvn clean test jacoco:report

# Run specific test class
mvn test -Dtest=ModernizedApplicationTest

# Run with specific profile
mvn test -Dspring.profiles.active=jboss
```

### Using IDE
- Import the project into IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
- Right-click on test class or method and select "Run Test"
- View coverage reports in IDE's coverage tool

## Code Coverage
The test suite is configured to achieve minimum 20% code coverage as required:
- Line coverage: >20%
- Branch coverage: Focused on critical paths
- Method coverage: All public methods tested

## Test Frameworks Used
- **JUnit 5 (Jupiter)**: Modern testing framework with parameterized tests
- **Mockito 5**: For mocking dependencies
- **Spring Boot Test**: For integration testing
- **AssertJ**: For fluent assertions
- **JaCoCo**: For code coverage reporting

## Best Practices Implemented
1. **Given-When-Then** pattern for test structure
2. **@DisplayName** annotations for readable test names
3. **Parameterized tests** for testing multiple scenarios
4. **Mock objects** for isolating units under test
5. **Test data builders** for complex object creation

## CI/CD Integration
These tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions configuration
- name: Run Tests
  run: mvn clean test
  
- name: Generate Coverage Report
  run: mvn jacoco:report
  
- name: Upload Coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

## Future Enhancements
1. Add integration tests for database operations
2. Include performance tests for JDK 17 optimizations
3. Add contract tests for REST APIs
4. Include security tests for JBoss configurations
