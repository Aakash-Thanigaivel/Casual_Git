CUSTOMER.DAT - Sample ETL Data File for Testing
=================================================

This is a sample data file that would be read by the COBOL ETL program.
Each line represents a customer record in the format expected by the COBOL program.

Data Format (Fixed Length):
- Customer ID: 8 digits
- Customer Name: 30 characters
- Account Type: 1 character (C=Checking, S=Savings, B=Business)
- Balance: 7 digits + 2 decimal places (9999999.99)
- Credit Limit: 7 digits + 2 decimal places (9999999.99)
- Status: 1 character (A=Active, I=Inactive, S=Suspended)

Expected Processing Results:
- Valid records should be processed and written to PROCESSED.DAT
- Invalid records should be written to ERRORS.DAT with error descriptions
- Processing statistics should be calculated and displayed

This ETL data file contains various scenarios for testing:
- Valid customer records
- Records with different account types
- Records with different balance ranges
- Records that may fail validation (like low balance inactive accounts)
